# Security

## Human Controls

- Github PR Code reviews, requiring code owner approval and passing checks
- CI checks include CodeQL, TFSec, Unit and Integration tests, and a deployed environment.
- TFSec custom rules so we can enforce own requirements
- Dependabot which checks daily for deps updates and creates PRs

## Account Controls

- Breakglass access to production account only - TODO
- All AWS account actions collected by CloudTrail
- AWS Cloudtrail and NHSD LandingZone enforcement of NHSD security requirements.
- AWS Config rules to ensure ongoing conformance
- Account level S3 Public Access blocking
- IAM password policy increased requirements (not used though)
- All non-`eu-west-2` regions have had default resources destroyed - TODO

## AWS Controls

- AWS Cloudtrail (via LandingZone)
- Get all the SCPs enabled - TODO
- AWS Well Architected Review - TODO
- AWS Config
- KMS for S3, Dynamo, Cloudwatch and SSM
- CloudWatch logs, need to be forwarded to Splunk - TODO

## AWS Network Controls

- VPC per account with private, intra and public subnets
- Intra (no-outbound internet access) Subnets for data processing Lambdas
- Internet/NAT Gateways, Routing Tables etc
- Splunk Forwarding, Email and Mesh Lambdas sit in Public Subnets
- VPC Endpoints for Step Functions, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 and SSM in Private Subnets
- VPC Flow Logs and shipping to Splunk - TODO
- VPC ACLs, only 443 out, high ports return - TODO?

## Observability Controls

- Splunk Dashboards - TODO
- Splunk Alerting - TODO

## Testing Controls

- Pytest, unit testing
- Behave, integrating testing
- Github Actions, for CI enforcing testing as part of pipeline

## Supply Chain Controls

- Github Dependabot and CodeQL scanning
- Artefact based automated deployment, so only code build happens once on merge to main branch, this can be scanned further - TODO
- Use of pipenv, as pip and requirements.txt do not provide a lock based mechanism that can ensure we're using the same hash of downloaded libraries
- Lambdas doing data handling should have minimal use of non-standard library python, reviewed on a per requirement basis
- Move to continuous/automated deployment, so deployment times cannot be socially engineered or guessed - TODO

## NHSD Controls

- Spine Incident management/response
- Frequent Security/Pen Testing
