* connect to s3 and upload gpfile file "A82023_GPR4LNA1.EIA" for successful file validation
* connect to pass folder and check if it has loaded the test file


## test to ensure when lambda LR-02 is triggered and response status code 202 is recieved
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* trigger lambda LR-02 and assert response status code is "202"
* trigger lambda LR-02  and assert responsemetadata HTTPStatusCode response is "202"
