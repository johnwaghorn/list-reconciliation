## Lambda LR-12 can see mismatch information of PDS data for a record that is on PDS but not on practice
* check lambda LR-12 has run
* connect to lr-13 and check output csv file content and file format as expected for <Job Id> and <GP ODS Code>


## Test to ensure Step Functions LR-10 can receive a job id and trigger LR12 to produce an output file
* connect to step function LR-10 and pass in job id and return successful execution response
* connect to lr-13 and check output csv file content and file format as expected for <Job Id> and <GP ODS Code>
